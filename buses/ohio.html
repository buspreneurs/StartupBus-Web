<p>On May 15th, some of the best makers, hackers, hustlers, and designers will come together in Akron Ohio to represent Northeast Ohio in the most epic competition the Americas has ever seen – combing the magic of a hackathon and a road trip to create the ultimate adventure on wheels.</p>

<p>For the first time @TheStartupBus will depart from Akron Ohio and go head to head with buses from 6 other cities to see who can create the most innovative business on their way to Boulder Colorado.

<p>Once there where you'll get the chance to make your pitch on stage at Techstars' Boulder Startup Week.</p>



<p>We're not going to sugarcoat it, the ride to Colorado will be tough. We'll be stopping in cities all over the US and we're not going to tell you what they are. You're not going to get much sleep and you may have to fight people off to charge your devices. You'll be pushed past your limits and will go through <b>all</b> the feels. But it'll all be worth it when you find greatness on the other side.</p>



    <p>We can promise you that the few, the proud, the brave who are selected to join our elite crew will leave with the experience of a lifetime, a new group of best friends/business partners, a whole new view of what's possible and plenty of tales from the trenches.</p>


    <p>So what are you waiting for? Apply now for the chance to join the most exclusive community in tech and see if you have what it takes to hit the pedal to the metal.</p>
    <p>See you on the other side!</p>
